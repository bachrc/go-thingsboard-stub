# Thingsboard-stub

The name is quite self-explanatory : this program is meant to simulate a device (an arduino/industruino) interacting
with a Thingsboard server, for testing purposes.

For now you can simulate two types of devices :
- A boolean type : like the state of the switch
- A float type : for temperatures for example.

### Installation

In order to install the stub, your just need to have Go installed. And do :

```
go get github.com/bachrc/thingsboard-stub/cmd/thingsboard-stub
```

Then if your $PATH is well configured containing $GOPATH/bin, the following command should show you the usage :

```

```
